            <h1>History of Climbing</h1>
                <p>Climbing was fairly obsolete as a recreational activity for many years. The original climbing started in an occupational manner, often as tree fallers and other necessary jobs during the late 19th century, and into the early 1900s. In the 1930s, several "dirt-bag" climbers began to modernize the once "necessity-only" sport into a more recreational way of living.</p>
                <p>The well known activity of big wall climbing began in the 1950s with early climbers such as Royal Robbins, Tom Frost, and Walter Bonatti. During the formative years of Rock Climbing, the gear was often very rugged. Going into the more modern years of climbing such as the 70s, 80s, and 90s, companies began to pop up that were more and more geared towards creating high quality gear to provide a safer ascent for these climbers. The early 2000s is where sport climbing and speed climbing began to pick up in popularity. Rock Climbers such as <strong>Chris Sharma</strong>, <strong>Tommy Caldwell</strong>, <strong>Alex Honnald</strong>, and others began popping out of the wood works. These modern-day climbers continue to help shape climbing as we know it.</p>
